## Other Project Ideas
Some ideas I have for games and their plots.

### Unnamed Racing Game
In the universe exists a powerful force called fuelence, but because it’s so powerful the usage of these fuelence is only allowed under certain circumstances. One of them is the interdimensional racing tournament (IRT). The IRT is hold every century and the only opportunity to compete against each other. The winner gets the desirable galaxy trophy and the title of universal-racing-champion.
